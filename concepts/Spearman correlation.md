Measures monotonic relationships (increasing or decreasing, but not necessarily linear)
Based on rankings of the values and not their actual numbers 
Why would log returns and volume still have a strong non-linear relationship, even if Spearman is low?
1. Volume and returns are infleucned by other drivers - like news, macroeconomic events, or company-specific annoucnements. These can. causes both volume and return to spike, but not in a consistent, monotonic fashion
2. So even though they might co-occur during extreme events (e.g high volume on crash days), the relationship is not stable or systematic enough to show up in Spearman or Pearson correlation.
